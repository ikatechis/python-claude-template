# Ideas & Brainstorming Pool

This document is a living collection of ideas, fragments, and potential content for the game. Everything here is raw material for storylets, characters, mechanics, and moments.

---

## How to Use This Document

- Add ideas freely without worrying about structure
- Tag ideas with categories: `[STORYLET]`, `[NPC]`, `[MECHANIC]`, `[LOCATION]`, `[SONG]`, `[DIALOGUE]`, `[HISTORICAL]`, `[VISUAL]`
- When an idea is used, mark it with `[USED]` and note where
- Periodically review and promote good ideas to proper design docs

## Story Moments

### Opening/Tutorial

`[STORYLET]` The keepsake choice should echo throughout the game:
- Photograph: Can be shown to NPCs ("Do you know this face?")
- Coin: Can be used in desperate moment or gambled
- Key: Opens something unexpected in Act 2
- Nothing: Unlocks "empty hands" dialogue options

`[STORYLET]` The old musician's death should be foreshadowed. He coughs. He's thin. He plays despite pain. When the player finally finds him in the sick tents, it's not a surprise — it's an inevitability they've been watching.

`[STORYLET]` Dimitris should have a defining moment where he has to choose between the player and his uncle. Whatever he chooses defines their relationship going forward.

### Tekes Scenes

`[STORYLET]` The Parangelia violation scene (from research dossier):
- Someone interrupts a paid Zeibekiko
- The player is playing/watching
- They must decide: keep playing, stop, intervene
- This should be a memorable early tekes moment

`[STORYLET]` The "Tourist Tax" — rich Athenians come slumming:
- They're overcharged for everything
- Musicians mock them in slang they don't understand
- Player can join the mockery or stay neutral
- One tourist might become important later (connection to "legitimate" world)

`[STORYLET]` First time smoking hashish:
- The ritual should be detailed, accurate to research
- The sensory experience should be distinct
- Mechanical effect: temporary psychi boost, possible addiction start
- Visual: maybe the screen shifts slightly, sounds stretch

`[STORYLET]` A police raid on the tekes:
- Warning signals from lookout
- Scramble to hide instruments, hashish
- Some escape through roof
- Player choice: help others, save self, stay hidden
- Getting caught has serious consequences

### Music Moments

`[STORYLET]` Learning your first song:
- Should feel like a ritual, not just "skill unlocked"
- The NPC teaching you should have a reason
- The song itself should have meaning

`[STORYLET]` First public performance:
- Terror and exhilaration
- The crowd might be hostile or supportive
- First hartoura (tips) should feel earned

`[STORYLET]` Hearing someone play YOUR song:
- Later in game, if the player has become known
- Another musician plays something you composed
- Pride? Jealousy? A sign of success?

### Crime Moments

`[STORYLET]` First real crime (not just lookout):
- Should feel transgressive
- Clear choice to back out
- If successful, the "easy money" is seductive

`[STORYLET]` The Falanga scene — police torture:
- If caught, the player might face the falanga
- Beating on the soles of the feet
- A test of whether you "break" (inform) or hold
- Walking out without limping = respect

`[STORYLET]` A friend turns informer:
- Maybe Dimitris, maybe someone else
- The discovery, the confrontation
- What do you do with a karfia (snitch)?

### Sailor Moments

`[STORYLET]` First time seeing Alexandria:
- A different Greek community
- Hearing familiar music in a foreign place
- The longing theme crystallized

`[STORYLET]` A storm at sea:
- Fear, helplessness
- Maybe someone dies
- The sea as a character

### Relationship Moments

`[STORYLET]` The impossible love:
- A woman from a "respectable" family
- She's fascinated by the music world
- Her family would never accept a rebetis
- Romeo and Juliet, Piraeus style

`[STORYLET]` The rivalry that becomes friendship:
- Or the friendship that becomes rivalry
- A musical competitor
- Respect through conflict

## NPC Ideas

`[NPC]` **The Matchmaker** — An older woman who runs a café, knows everyone's business, arranges marriages, trades in gossip. Could be useful or dangerous.

`[NPC]` **The Priest's Son** — Father Alexandros has a son who has fallen in with criminals. The father doesn't know. The son might become friend or enemy.

`[NPC]` **The Recording Engineer** — A German technician at Columbia studios. Precise, demanding, but secretly loves the music. Gateway to the recording world.

`[NPC]` **The Police Inspector** — Not all cops are brutal. This one is smart, watches the player, might offer a deal. Cat and mouse.

`[NPC]` **The American** — A Greek-American who returns to Piraeus, bringing money and strange ideas. Diaspora perspective.

`[NPC]` **The Child** — A younger refugee the player can protect (or not). Mirrors the player's own journey.

---

## Mechanical Ideas

`[MECHANIC]` **The Dream System**:
- When psychi is very low or very high, the player might have dreams
- Dreams could be memories, premonitions, or surreal experiences
- A way to deliver backstory and foreshadowing

`[MECHANIC]` **Seasonal Events**:
- Greek Easter should be a major event
- Carnival season
- August heat (different mechanics, health risks)
- Winter cold

`[MECHANIC]` **The Newspaper**:
- A mechanic where the player can read headlines
- Reflects historical events
- Might contain relevant gossip or job leads

`[MECHANIC]` **The Letter System**:
- Writing/receiving letters from people far away

- Could connect to the family_lost backstory

`[MECHANIC]` **Instrument Maintenance**:
- Bouzouki strings break
- Need to find/buy replacements
- Adds economic pressure to music path

## Historical Fragments

`[HISTORICAL]` The Nansen passport — stateless refugee document. Could be a plot point, needed for certain actions.

`[HISTORICAL]` The "Mandra" of Batis — real venue where refugees and aristocrats mixed. Use as model for the cafe.

`[HISTORICAL]` The 1929 financial crisis reached Greece. Economic storylets around this period.

`[HISTORICAL]` Metaxas's rise: 1935 election turmoil, 1936 coup. The noose tightening.

`[HISTORICAL]` Specific recording dates: First Vamvakaris recording 1932. Could be a story beat.

---

## Dialogue Fragments

`[DIALOGUE]` "Clean hands mean dirty money." — Said about anyone without calluses.

`[DIALOGUE]` "He speaks Katharevousa." — Code for "He's a cop or a spy. Stop talking."

`[DIALOGUE]` "The government changes every Tuesday; the poverty stays forever."

`[DIALOGUE]` "Don't whistle at night. It calls the demons — or the patrol."

`[DIALOGUE]` "I hold this song. It is mine until I finish or I fall."

`[DIALOGUE]` "Pire fotia" — "It caught fire" — Said when the hookah is properly lit.

`[DIALOGUE]` "Gia sou, pethane to thanato!" — "Health to you, make death die!" — Praise for a performer.

---

## Visual Ideas

`[VISUAL]` The shacks of Kokkinia — made from flattened kerosene tins, giving a shiny metallic look in the sun. Distinctive visual.

`[VISUAL]` The "palomata" — wooden rooms built on top of mud-brick shacks. Precarious second stories.

`[VISUAL]` The coal yards (Karvouniarika) — black dust covering everything. A specific hellish look.

`[VISUAL]` The sea caves below Kastella — used by smugglers. Could be a hidden location.

`[VISUAL]` The roof-running escape routes — houses so close you can jump between them.

---

## Song Ideas

`[SONG]` A song about the boat from Smyrna. The player learns it from Panagis. It becomes their signature.

`[SONG]` A mocking song about politicians (like Vamvakaris's real "Osoi Ginoun Prothypourgoi")

`[SONG]` A prison song learned in prison (if that path is taken)

`[SONG]` A love song that becomes ironic if the relationship ends badly

---

## Questions to Resolve

- How explicit should violence be? Blood? Death on screen?
- How do we handle the hashish without glorifying or condemning it?
- The protagonist's gender: always male? Option for female? Historical accuracy vs. inclusion?
- How much Turkish language to include? Many refugees were bilingual.
- Do we show the Metaxas era, or end before it? (Probably show it — it's the climax)

---

## Rejected Ideas

(Move ideas here that we've decided against, with reasons)

## To Research

- Specific slang terms and their usage
- Daily schedule of a typical tekes (when does it open?)
- How did recording sessions actually work? How long? How many takes?
- What did Columbia pay musicians per recording?
- Ship routes from Piraeus in 1920s-30s
- Prison conditions — which prison would a Piraeus criminal go to?
